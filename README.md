# Interactive Charts Using Shiny and Plotly

Visualization is one of the best ways to understand the characteristics of the data. It allows the decision makers to easily understand the difficult concepts or patterns. In some cases, interactive visualizations will be more efficient. 

When I came across the TED talk by Hans Rosling, I had no idea about how to build such beautiful interactive charts. I had only started learning to code at that time. After learning some basics in R, I just decided to try it out.

This is how I built interactive charts with R using the packages Shiny and Plotly.


## About the Data
**1. Under-five Mortality**

This dataset is from Gapminder which shows the death of children under five years of age per 1000 live births, in all countries from 1800–2018.

**2. Global Educational Attainment**

These are IHME results data from a global analysis of educational attainment spanning the last 50 years.
This data file provides estimates of average years of educational attainment per capita for female over the age of 15 for the years 1970–2015. Age-standardized and population-weighted estimates are included for females 15–44.

**3. GDP Per Capita**

The values expressed in international $(PPP) and adjusted for inflation (in 2000 prices). The indicator measures the same thing as "income per person", the source is: Penn World Tables 62.

**4. Anemia in Pregnant Women**

This data shows the prevalence of anemia in pregnant women (in percent) in all countries from 1990- 2016.
